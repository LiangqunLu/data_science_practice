## Reusable Project Components

1. **Data Analysis Pipeline**
   ```python
   # Standard imports for data analysis
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   ```
   - Basic data loading and exploration
   - Null value checking
   - Data shape and basic statistics
   - Can be used for any tabular data project

2. **Visualization Framework**
   ```python
   # Core visualization setup
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
   sns.set_style()
   %matplotlib inline
   ```
   - Distribution plots (histplot, kdeplot)
   - Time-based analysis (temporal patterns)
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Box plots and violin plots for outlier detection
   - Scatter plots for relationship analysis

3. **Statistical Analysis Module**
   ```python
   from scipy.stats import ttest_ind, mannwhitneyu
   ```
   - Statistical significance testing
   - Feature-target relationship analysis
   - Can be applied to any binary classification problem

4. **Feature Engineering Pipeline**
   ```python
   # Time-based feature engineering
   features['sin_hour'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * features['Hour'] / 24)
   features['cos_hour'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * features['Hour'] / 24)
   ```
   - Cyclical feature encoding
   - Feature selection based on importance
   - Standardization of numerical features

5. **Imbalanced Data Handling**
   ```python
   from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
   ```
   - SMOTE for handling imbalanced classes
   - Before/after distribution analysis
   - Applicable to any imbalanced classification problem

6. **Model Building Framework**
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, StratifiedKFold, GridSearchCV
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   import xgboost as xgb
   ```
   - Data splitting
   - Cross-validation
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Model training and evaluation

7. **Model Evaluation Suite**
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import (
       classification_report, 
       confusion_matrix, 
       roc_auc_score, 
       roc_curve
   )
   ```
   - Performance metrics calculation
   - ROC curve visualization
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Confusion matrix analysis

8. **Time Series Analysis Components**
   ```python
   # Time binning and analysis
   hour_bins = [0, 6, 12, 18, 24]
   pd.cut(data['Hour'], bins=hour_bins, labels=hour_labels)
   ```
   - Time period binning
   - Temporal pattern analysis
   - Applicable to any time-series data

9. **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**
   ```python
   # Standard preprocessing steps
   scaler = StandardScaler()
   features = scaler.fit_transform(features)
   ```
   - Feature scaling
   - Feature selection
   - Missing value handling

10. **Documentation Structure**
